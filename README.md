# FiftyFlow

Welcome to **FiftyFlow** — a simple Pomodoro-style break timer designed for **50-minute flow states** and **10-minute structured recovery**.

I made this because I found that traditional Pomodoro timers (25/5) didn’t match how my team or I naturally worked. We needed longer deep work periods, without losing the rhythm of the hour.

**FiftyFlow** syncs your work and break cycles to the real-world clock, chiming every time you hit a :00 or :50.  

No accounts, no ads, no distractions. Just a lightweight, flexible way to stay in sync with your best working pace.

## Why I Built It
I'm not a professional coder. I just like making small tools that solve real-world workflow problems for myself and my team.  

FiftyFlow was created to help prevent burnout, encourage real recovery breaks, and build a natural cadence without micromanaging yourself.
